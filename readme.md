# Problem-Solving

## Repository Outline
- This repository contains various solutions to coding problems and algorithmic challenges.
- The solutions are implemented in Python.

## Repository Structure
- There is a directory for each platform,
- Each directory contains Jupyter notebooks, one for each problem,
- Each notebook contains:
> - Problem outline: the problem statements for the coding problems solved in this repo.
> - Solution: the solution implemented in Python.
> - Examples: test cases for the implemented solutions.

## Usage
- To run a specific solution:
- Navigate to the relevant directory,
- Locate the relevant notebook file for the problem you want to solve,
- Run the notebook to run the test cases.

## Contributing
- Contributions to this repository are welcome!
